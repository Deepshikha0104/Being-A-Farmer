Farma Assistant (Agro Product Marketplace Web Application)

Here's a normal flow description for your Farma Assistant project, suitable for explaining it in an interview, on your portfolio, or in a less formal context where ATS optimization isn't the primary concern.
Farma Assistant is a dynamic web application I developed to create an online marketplace specifically for agro products. Built using Flask (Python) for the backend and an SQL database for data management, the application provides a user-friendly and responsive experience for buying and selling agricultural goods.

I focused on designing an intuitive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure seamless navigation and a pleasant user journey. Key functionalities include a robust user authentication system that allows secure access for all users, comprehensive product listings where sellers can showcase their produce, and efficient Browse features for buyers to easily find what they need.

This project allowed me to apply and solidify my skills in full-stack web development, from designing the database schema to implementing client-side interactivity. It was a great opportunity to build a complete application that addresses a real-world need in the agricultural sector.
